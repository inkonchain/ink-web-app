          13. Privacy when using digital assets and blockchains
        </ColoredText>
        <div>
          Your use of digital assets may be recorded on a public blockchain.
          Public blockchains are distributed ledgers, intended to immutably
          record transactions across wide networks of computer systems. Many
          blockchains are open to forensic analysis which can lead to
          re-identification of transacting individuals and the revelation of
          personal data, especially when blockchain data is combined with other
          data. As blockchains are decentralized or third-party networks which
          are not controlled or operated by Ink Ltd, we are not able to erase,
          modify, or alter personal data on such networks.
