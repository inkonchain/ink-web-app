I exported the Google doc as HTML, copied the relevant sections here, and then used Cursor change the stuff to make sense.

Here is the prompt that I used (change the examples if needed):


 Do the following:

 1. Find which class is a bold element, and keep a "font-bold" class for those elements. An example is "Arbitration Agreement"
 2. Find which class is an underline element, and keep an "underline" class for those elements. An example is "Informal Process First"
 3. Not text should be deleted, but remove empty things, inline styles, and classes that do nothing.
 4. Change <a> elements to Link elements and update the google links to be relative paths
 5. Change lists to ul and li with 'className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2"'
 6. Change single list ol + li into a ColoredText component with 'variant="purple"' and the text-2xl or text-4xl class depending on the heading level. For instance, numbered items should have text-4xl. Use text-6xl for the main header. If the elements needs to be bold, add "font-bold" to the class as well.
 7. Change mailto:legal to EXTERNAL_LINKS.legal and a Link component
 8. All links should have classes "text-blue-500 hover:underline" and 'target="_blank' and 'rel="noopener noreferrer"'
 9. Wrap the whole thing in a fragment: `<></>`
 10. In the text, change the ' character with "&apos;", the " character with "&quot;"

      <p className="underline">Informal Process First</p>

        and must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and
        (b) set forth the specific relief sought. If we and you do not resolve
        the claim or dispute set out in the Notice within sixty (60) calendar
        days from the date of receipt, we or you may commence an arbitration
        proceeding. It is agreed that this dispute resolution procedure is a
        condition precedent which must be satisfied before initiating
        arbitration.
      </p>

      <p className="underline">Arbitration and its Terms</p>

      <p>
        Subject to the informal process outlined in the preceding paragraph, you
        and us agree to arbitrate any dispute arising in connection with these
        Official Rules (including questions related to their validity,
        existence, or termination), except for disputes in which either party
        seeks equitable and other relief for the alleged unlawful use of
        copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents.
      </p>

      <p>
        The arbitration will be administered in accordance with the Rules of the
        London Court of International Arbitration then in effect (the &quot;
        <span className="font-bold">LCIA Rules</span>&quot;). It will be
        conducted in English and the parties will keep the arbitration
        proceedings confidential and not disclose any information regarding the
        arbitration (or any underlying claim or dispute) to any third party
        except as required by law.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other than class procedures and remedies expressly prohibited by this
        Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator(s) will have the authority to
        provide any remedy or relief that a court of competent jurisdiction
        could award, including injunctive relief. Any decision or award rendered
        by the arbitrator will be final and binding, and may be overturned by a
        court only for very limited reasons. Any judgment may be entered in any
        court of competent jurisdiction.
      </p>

      <p>
        If there is any inconsistency between any term of the LCIA Rules and any
        term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this
        Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that
        the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would
        not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also
        follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would.
      </p>

      <p className="font-bold">
        It is expressly agreed that any arbitration under these Official Rules
        will take place on an individual basis – class arbitrations and class
        action are not permitted. You understand that by agreeing to these
        Official Rules, you and us are each waiving the right to trial by jury
        or to participate in a class action or class arbitration.
      </p>

      <p className="underline">Costs of Arbitration</p>

      <p>
        Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator costs and expenses
        will be governed by the LCIA Rules then in effect, except that if you
        demonstrate that any such costs and expenses owed by you under those
        rules would be prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding,
        then we will pay the amount of any such costs and expenses that the
        arbitrator determines are necessary to prevent the arbitration from
        being prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law.
        The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment
        and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding
        and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the
        arbitrator&apos;s ruling on the merits.
      </p>

      <p className="underline">Batch Arbitration</p>

      <p>
        To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of
        arbitrations, you and us agree that in the event that there are
        one-hundred (100) or more individual claims of a substantially similar
        nature filed against us by or with the assistance of the same law firm,
        group of law firms, or organizations, then within a thirty (30) day
        period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the LCIA shall (a)
        administer the arbitration demands in batches of one-hundred (100)
        claims per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than one-hundred
        (100) claims left over after the batching described above, a final batch
        consisting of the remaining claims); (b) appoint one arbitrator for each
        batch; and (c) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single
        consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees
        due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in
        a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (&quot;
        <span className="font-bold">Batch Arbitration</span>&quot;). All parties
        agree that claims are of a &quot;substantially similar nature&quot; if
        they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and
        raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar
        relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the
        Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the LCIA,
        and the LCIA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the
        applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (&quot;
        <span className="font-bold">Administrative Arbitrator</span>&quot;). In
        an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the
        Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative
        Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any
        disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator&apos;s fees shall be
        paid by us. You and us agree to cooperate in good faith with the LCIA to
        implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single
        filing and administrative fees for batches of claims, as well as any
        steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include:
        (i) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the
        arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (ii) the
        adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings. This
        Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as
        authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any
        kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any
        circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.

        MAKE AN AWARD TO ANY PERSON OR ENTITY NOT A PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION.
        FURTHER, YOU AND US AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE
        PROCEEDINGS FOR MORE THAN ONE PERSON&apos;S CLAIMS, AND IT MAY NOT
        OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CLASS ACTION (OTHER THAN THE BATCH
