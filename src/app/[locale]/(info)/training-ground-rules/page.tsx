            Other than class procedures and remedies expressly prohibited by
            this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator(s) will have the
            authority to provide any remedy or relief that a court of competent
            jurisdiction could award, including injunctive relief. Any decision
            or award rendered by the arbitrator will be final and binding, and
            may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. Any
            judgment may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

            If there is any inconsistency between any term of the LCIA Rules and
            any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this
            Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines
            that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms
            would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator
            must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would.

            It is expressly agreed that any arbitration under these Official
            Rules will take place on an individual basis – class arbitrations
            and class action are not permitted. You understand that by agreeing
            to these Official Rules, you and us are each waiving the right to
            trial by jury or to participate in a class action or class
            arbitration.

            Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator costs and
            expenses will be governed by the LCIA Rules then in effect, except
            that if you demonstrate that any such costs and expenses owed by you
            under those rules would be prohibitively more expensive than a court
            proceeding, then we will pay the amount of any such costs and
            expenses that the arbitrator determines are necessary to prevent the
            arbitration from being prohibitively more expensive than a court
            proceeding.

            Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable

            payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the
            proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of
            the arbitrator&apos;s ruling on the merits.

            To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of
            arbitrations, you and us agree that in the event that there are
            one-hundred (100) or more individual claims of a substantially
            similar nature filed against us by or with the assistance of the
            same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, then within a
            thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the LCIA
            shall (a) administer the arbitration demands in batches of
            one-hundred (100) claims per batch (plus, to the extent there are
            less than one-hundred (100) claims left over after the batching
            described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining claims);
            (b) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (c) provide for the
            resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with
            one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch,
            one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be

            factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek
            the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on
            the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing
            party shall advise the LCIA, and the LCIA shall appoint a sole
            standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch
            Arbitration process (&quot;Administrative Arbitrator&quot;). In an
            effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the
            Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative
            Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve
            any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator&apos;s fees

            as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which
            may include: (i) the appointment of a discovery special master to
            assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and
            (ii) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration
            proceedings.
