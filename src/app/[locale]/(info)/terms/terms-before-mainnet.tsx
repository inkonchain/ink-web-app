      <b>2. Ink</b>

      <div>
        Ink is a layer 2 optimistic rollup for the Ethereum blockchain (“
        <b>Ink</b>”) built on open source software that we do not control. Ink
        includes certain open source smart contracts that can receive and hold
        certain digital currency or other digital assets (“
        <b>Digital Assets</b>”), which are then represented on Ink (“
        <b>Bridge Smart Contracts</b>”). You may also use the Bridge Smart
        Contract to withdraw your Digital Assets from Ink. We do not take
        possession, custody, or control of any Digital Assets on Ink or sent to
        its Bridge Smart Contracts. There is a risk that the open source
        software, including any upgrades, that the Ink is built on may introduce
        bugs, viruses, Trojan horses, or other vulnerabilities or changes to Ink
        that could result in a partial or complete disruption of Ink or loss,
        damage, or destruction of your Digital Assets. IWe do not control third
        party applications, including their development or deployment, on Ink,
        or any activity or transactions occurring on Ink. Therefore, you
        acknowledge and agree that Ink, including its Bridge Smart Contracts,
        are not part of our Services, and we have no obligations or liability to
        you in relation to your use of Ink or its Bridge Smart Contracts, and
        you use Ink and its Bridge Smart Contracts at your own risk.

        <span className="underline">Testnet</span>
      </div>

      <div>
        The Ink testnet (the “<b>Testnet</b>”) provides a testing environment
        intended to reproduce the functionality and experience of Ink to allow
        you to develop applications for Ink and otherwise improve the stability,
        security, and design of Ink and applications built for Ink. Any Testnet
        tokens are for testing purposes on the Testnet, have no value, and are
        not redeemable or convertible for any other token or item of value. Ink
        may change, upgrade, discontinue, or terminate the Testnet at any time
        and without notice.
      </div>

      <div>
        <span className="underline">Ink Sequencer</span>
      </div>

        Ink operates a node that receives, records, and combines multiple
        transaction records from Ink into batches, which are then settled to the
        Ethereum blockchain in a specified format (the “<b>Ink Sequencer</b>”).
        You are not required to use the Ink Sequencer. If you use the Ink
        Sequencer, you agree to pay any applicable gas fees, which may be
        modified at any time. The Ink Sequencer does not store, take possession,
        custody, or control of your Digital Assets at any time, except for
        receiving applicable gas fees. It also does not have the ability to
        modify, reverse, or otherwise modify any transactions submitted to the
        Ethereum blockchain.Applicable gas fees received in connection with your
        use of the Ink Sequencer may be modified at any time.
      </div>

      <b>4. Third Party Services</b>

      <div>
        When using our Services or Ink (including Bridge Smart Contracts), you
        may have the opportunity to use third party services. We do not verify,
        approve, monitor, control or endorse any third-party services and are
        not liable to you for third-party content or services in any way. Your
        use of third-party content or services may be subject to additional
        terms and conditions with third-parties, and we are not part of those
        terms or conditions. You may also incur third-party fees, such as fees
        associated with third-party services, or other fees, such as gas fees.
        You&apos;re solely responsible for paying all such fees. If any
        third-party terms and conditions conflict with these Terms, you agree
        that these Terms control. Under no circumstances shall Ink incur any
        liability, of any kind, to you arising from or relating to fees charged
        to you by third-party services linked to or accessed through our
        Services or Ink (including Bridge Smart Contracts).

          PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU
          TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH US AND IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU
          CAN SEEK RELIEF.
        </b>
      </div>
      <div>
        You and us agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms or

        seeks equitable and other relief for the alleged unlawful use of
        copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents.
        ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY
        TRIAL. You and us agree to notify each other in writing of any dispute
        within 30 days of when it arises. Notice to us must be sent to
        legal@inkonchain.com. You and us further agree: (a) to attempt informal
        resolution prior to any demand for arbitration; (b) that any arbitration
        will occur in San Francisco, California; (c) that arbitration will be
        conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the
        rules of JAMS; and (d) that the state or federal courts in San
        Francisco, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an
        arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to
        arbitration. Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below,
        the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would
        otherwise be available in court. Any dispute between the parties will be
        governed by these Terms and the laws of the State of California and
        applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict of
        laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of
        another jurisdiction. Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in
        court, you and us won&apos;t commence against the other a class action,
        class arbitration or representative action or proceeding.
