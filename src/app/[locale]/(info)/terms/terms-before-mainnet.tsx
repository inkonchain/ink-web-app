          <b>2. Ink</b>

          <div>
            Ink is a layer 2 optimistic rollup for the Ethereum blockchain (“
            <b>Ink</b>”) built on open source software that we do not control.
            Ink includes certain open source smart contracts that can receive
            and hold certain digital currency or other digital assets (“
            <b>Digital Assets</b>”), which are then represented on Ink (“
            <b>Bridge Smart Contracts</b>”). You may also use the Bridge Smart
            Contract to withdraw your Digital Assets from Ink. We do not take
            possession, custody, or control of any Digital Assets on Ink or sent
            to its Bridge Smart Contracts. There is a risk that the open source
            software, including any upgrades, that the Ink is built on may
            introduce bugs, viruses, Trojan horses, or other vulnerabilities or
            changes to Ink that could result in a partial or complete disruption
            of Ink or loss, damage, or destruction of your Digital Assets. IWe
            do not control third party applications, including their development
            or deployment, on Ink, or any activity or transactions occurring on
            Ink. Therefore, you acknowledge and agree that Ink, including its
            Bridge Smart Contracts, are not part of our Services, and we have no
            obligations or liability to you in relation to your use of Ink or
            its Bridge Smart Contracts, and you use Ink and its Bridge Smart
            Contracts at your own risk.

          <div>
            <span className="underline">Testnet</span>
          </div>

          <div>
            The Ink testnet (the “<b>Testnet</b>”) provides a testing
            environment intended to reproduce the functionality and experience
            of Ink to allow you to develop applications for Ink and otherwise
            improve the stability, security, and design of Ink and applications
            built for Ink. Any Testnet tokens are for testing purposes on the
            Testnet, have no value, and are not redeemable or convertible for
            any other token or item of value. Ink may change, upgrade,
            discontinue, or terminate the Testnet at any time and without
            notice.

          <div>
            <span className="underline">Ink Sequencer</span>
          </div>

          <div>
            Ink operates a node that receives, records, and combines multiple
            transaction records from Ink into batches, which are then settled to
            the Ethereum blockchain in a specified format (the “
            <b>Ink Sequencer</b>”). You are not required to use the Ink
            Sequencer. If you use the Ink Sequencer, you agree to pay any
            applicable gas fees, which may be modified at any time. The Ink
            Sequencer does not store, take possession, custody, or control of
            your Digital Assets at any time, except for receiving applicable gas
            fees. It also does not have the ability to modify, reverse, or
            otherwise modify any transactions submitted to the Ethereum
            blockchain.Applicable gas fees received in connection with your use
            of the Ink Sequencer may be modified at any time.

            or other fees, such as gas fees. You&apos;re solely responsible for
            paying all such fees. If any third-party terms and conditions
            conflict with these Terms, you agree that these Terms control. Under
            no circumstances shall Ink incur any liability, of any kind, to you
            arising from or relating to fees charged to you by third-party
            services linked to or accessed through our Services or Ink

            </b>
          </div>
          <div>
            You and us agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms
            or your use of the Services, except for disputes in which either
            party seeks equitable and other relief for the alleged unlawful use
            of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or
            patents. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING
            A JURY TRIAL. You and us agree to notify each other in writing of
            any dispute within 30 days of when it arises. Notice to us must be
            sent to legal@inkonchain.com. You and us further agree: (a) to
            attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration; (b)
            that any arbitration will occur in San Francisco, California; (c)
            that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single
            arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; and (d) that the
            state or federal courts in San Francisco, California have exclusive
            jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any
            suit between the parties not subject to arbitration. Other than
            class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has
            the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available
            in court. Any dispute between the parties will be governed by these
            Terms and the laws of the State of California and applicable United
            States law, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles
            that may provide for the application of the law of another
            jurisdiction. Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in
            court, you and us won&apos;t commence against the other a class
            action, class arbitration or representative action or proceeding.
