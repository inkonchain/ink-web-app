          <b>2. Ink</b>
          <div>
            Ink is a layer 2 optimistic rollup protocol for the Ethereum
            blockchain (“Ink”) built on open source software that we do not
            control. Ink includes functionality whereby certain open source
            smart contracts can receive and hold certain digital currency or
            other digital assets (“<b>Digital Assets</b>”) from certain
            supported blockchain networks such as Ethereum (“
            <b>Supported Networks</b>”), which are then represented on Ink (“
            <b>Bridge Smart Contracts</b>”). The Bridge Smart Contract can also
            be used to withdraw your Digital Assets from Ink back to Supported
            Networks. We do not take possession, custody, or control of any
            Digital Assets on Ink or sent to its Bridge Smart Contracts. There
            is a risk that the open source software, including any upgrades,
            that Ink is built on may introduce bugs, viruses, Trojan horses, or
            other vulnerabilities or changes to Ink that could result in a
            partial or complete disruption of Ink or loss, damage, or
            destruction of your Digital Assets. The Supported Networks, and the
            types of Digital Assets, that are capable of functionating with Ink
            and the Bridge Smart Contracts may also be subject to change at any
            time. We do not control third party applications, including their
            development or deployment, on Ink, or any activity or transactions
            occurring on Ink.{" "}
            <b>
              Therefore, you acknowledge and agree that Ink, including its
              Bridge Smart Contracts, are not part of our Services, and we have
              no obligations or liability to you in relation to your use of Ink
              or its Bridge Smart Contracts, and you use Ink and its Bridge

            third parties may deploy their own applications or interfaces to

          </div>
          <div>
            We operate the Ink testnet (the “<b>Testnet</b>”) as a testing
            environment that is intended to reproduce the functionality and
            experience of Ink. The Testnet is intended to allow you to develop
            applications for Ink and otherwise improve the stability, security,
            and design of Ink and applications built for Ink. Any Testnet tokens
            are for testing purposes on the Testnet, have no value, and are not
            redeemable or convertible for any other token or item of value. We
            may change, upgrade, discontinue, suspend, or terminate the Testnet
            at any time and without notice.

          <b>4. Third Party Services</b>
          <div>
            When using our Services or Ink (including Bridge Smart Contracts),
            you may have the opportunity to use or interact with third party
            services. We do not verify, approve, monitor, control or endorse any
            third-party services and are not liable to you for third-party
            services or third-party content displayed or otherwise made
            available on the Services. We are not responsible for, and make no
            representation as to, any third-party content or services. Your use
            of third-party content or services may be subject to additional
            terms and conditions with third-parties, and we are not part of
            those terms or conditions. You may also incur third-party fees, such
            as fees associated with third-party services, or other fees, such as
            gas fees. You&apos;re solely responsible for paying all such fees.
            If any third-party terms and conditions conflict with these Terms,
            you agree that these Terms control. Under no circumstances shall we
            incur any liability, of any kind, to you arising from or relating to
            fees charged to you by third-party content or services linked to or
            accessed through our Services or Ink (including Bridge Smart
            Contracts). Your interactions with third-party services, including
            digital wallets, are governed by their respective privacy policies.
            We are not responsible for their data practices.

          <div>
            Kraken Continuance (“<b>Kraken</b>”) operates a node that receives,
            records, and combines multiple transaction records from Ink into
            batches, which are then settled to the Ethereum blockchain in a
            specified format (the “<b>Kraken Sequencer</b>”). You are not
            required to use the Kraken Sequencer. If you use the Kraken
            Sequencer, you agree to pay any applicable gas fees, which may be
            modified at any time. Kraken will attempt to provide accurate gas
            fee information in connection with your use of the Kraken Sequencer,
            but such information reflects its estimate of gas fees, which may
            vary from the fees you actually pay to use the Kraken Sequencer and
            interact with Ink. The Kraken Sequencer does not store, take
            possession, custody, or control of your Digital Assets at any time,
            except for receiving applicable gas fees. It also does not have the
            ability to modify, reverse, or otherwise modify any transactions
            submitted to the Ethereum blockchain. Applicable gas fees received
            in connection with your use of the Kraken Sequencer may be modified
            at any time.

          <div>
            To use certain of the Services or the Kraken Sequencer, you may need
            to connect a compatible third-party digital wallet (“<b>Wallet</b>”)
            with the Services or the Kraken Sequencer. By using a Wallet in
            connection with the Services or the Kraken Sequencer, you agree that
            you are using the Wallet under the terms and conditions of the
            applicable third-party provider of such Wallet. Wallets are not
            associated with, maintained by, or affiliated with us. We accept no
            responsibility or liability to you in connection with your use of a
            Wallet, and we make no representations or warranties regarding how
            the Services, the Kraken Sequencer or Ink will operate or be
            compatible with any specific Wallet. The private keys necessary to
            access the assets held in a Wallet are not held by us. You are
            solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
            private keys and you are responsible for any transactions signed
            with your private keys. We reserve the right, in our sole
            discretion, to prohibit certain Wallet addresses from being able to
            use or engage in transactions using the Services or the Kraken
            Sequencer.

            efficiently, and most concerns can be resolved quickly and to your
            satisfaction by emailing user support at legal@inkonchain.com.
            However, if such efforts prove unsuccessful, you may send to us, by
            email, a written Notice of Dispute (“<b>Notice</b>”). The Notice
            should be sent to legal@inkonchain.com and must (a) describe the

            the date of receipt, we or you may commence an arbitration
            proceeding. It is agreed that this dispute resolution procedure is a
            condition precedent which must be satisfied before initiating
            arbitration.

          <span className="underline">Arbitration and its Terms</span>
          <div>
            Subject to the informal process outlined in the preceding paragraph,
            you and us agree to arbitrate any dispute arising in connection with
            these Terms (including questions related to their validity,
            existence, or termination) or your use of the Services and the
            Kraken Sequencer, except for disputes in which either party seeks
            equitable and other relief for the alleged unlawful use of
            copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or
            patents.{" "}
          </div>
          <div>
            The arbitration will be administered in accordance with the Rules of
            the London Court of International Arbitration then in effect (the “
            <b>LCIA Rules</b>”). It will be conducted in English and the parties
            will keep the arbitration proceedings confidential and not disclose
            any information regarding the arbitration (or any underlying claim
            or dispute) to any third party except as required by law.
          </div>
          <div>
            Other than class procedures and remedies expressly prohibited by
            this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator(s) will have the
            authority to provide any remedy or relief that a court of competent
            jurisdiction could award, including injunctive relief. Any decision
            or award rendered by the arbitrator will be final and binding, and
            may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. Any
            judgment may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.{" "}
          </div>
          <div>
            If there is any inconsistency between any term of the LCIA Rules and
            any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this
            Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines
            that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms
            would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator
            must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would.

              action are not permitted. You understand that by agreeing to these
              Terms, you and us are each waiving the right to trial by jury or

          <div>
            Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator costs and
            expenses will be governed by the LCIA Rules then in effect, except
            that if you demonstrate that any such costs and expenses owed by you
            under those rules would be prohibitively more expensive than a court
            proceeding, then we will pay the amount of any such costs and
            expenses that the arbitrator determines are necessary to prevent the
            arbitration from being prohibitively more expensive than a court
            proceeding.
          </div>
          <div>
            Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable
            law. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the
            payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the
            proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of
            the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

          <div>
            To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of
            arbitrations, you and us agree that in the event that there are
            one-hundred (100) or more individual claims of a substantially
            similar nature filed against us by or with the assistance of the
            same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, then within a
            thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the LCIA
            shall (a) administer the arbitration demands in batches of
            one-hundred (100) claims per batch (plus, to the extent there are
            less than one-hundred (100) claims left over after the batching
            described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining claims);
            (b) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (c) provide for the
            resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with
            one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch,
            one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be
            determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“
            <b>Batch Arbitration</b>”). All parties agree that claims are of a
            “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the
            same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal
            issues and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the
            parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration
            process, the disagreeing party shall advise the LCIA, and the LCIA
            shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the
            applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“
            <b>Administrative Arbitrator</b>”). In an effort to expedite
            resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the
            parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such
            procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The
            Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by us. You and us
            agree to cooperate in good faith with the LCIA to implement the
            Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and
            administrative fees for batches of claims, as well as any steps to
            minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (i)
            the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the
            arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (ii) the
            adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.
            This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as
            authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of
            any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims
            under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this

            STIPULATED IN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY.
          </div>
          <div>
            TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND US EACH
            AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDING TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM, OR
            CONTROVERSY WILL BE BROUGHT AND CONDUCTED ONLY IN THE RESPECTIVE
            PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS PART OF ANY CLASS (OR
            PURPORTED CLASS), CONSOLIDATED, MULTIPLE-PLAINTIFF, OR

          <div>
            YOU AND US AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR

            ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A CLASS ACTION IN ANY FORUM.{" "}

          <div>
            IF THE DISPUTE IS SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION, THE ARBITRATOR WILL NOT
            HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO COMBINE OR AGGREGATE CLAIMS, CONDUCT A CLASS
            ACTION, OR MAKE AN AWARD TO ANY PERSON OR ENTITY NOT A PARTY TO THE
            ARBITRATION . FURTHER, YOU AND US AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT
            CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS FOR MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND IT
            MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CLASS ACTION (OTHER
            THAN THE BATCH ARBITRATION SPECIFIED ABOVE). FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF
            DOUBT, HOWEVER, YOU CAN SEEK PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF TO THE EXTENT
            AUTHORIZED BY LAW AND CONSISTENT WITH THE EXCEPTIONS DESCRIBED
            ABOVE.
          </div>
          <div>
            IF THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER IS LIMITED, VOIDED, OR FOUND
            UNENFORCEABLE, THEN, UNLESS THE PARTIES MUTUALLY AGREE OTHERWISE,
            THE PARTIES’ AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SHALL BE NULL AND VOID WITH
            RESPECT TO SUCH PROCEEDING SO LONG AS THE PROCEEDING IS PERMITTED TO
            PROCEED AS A CLASS ACTION. If a court decides that the limitations
            of this paragraph are deemed invalid or unenforceable, any putative
            class, private attorney general, or consolidated or representative
            action must be brought in a court of proper jurisdiction and not in
            arbitration. You acknowledge and agree that this Arbitration
            Agreement applies equally to any claims or disputes between you and
            Kraken in connection with any dispute that arises in relation to
            your use of the Kraken Sequencer, and notices to Kraken may be
            provided to legal@kraken.com.

            You may not opt out of only the class action waiver and not also the
