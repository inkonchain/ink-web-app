      <b>2. Ink</b>
      <div>
        Ink is a layer 2 optimistic rollup protocol for the Ethereum blockchain
        (&quot;Ink&quot;) built on open source software that we do not control.
        Ink includes functionality whereby certain open source smart contracts
        can receive and hold certain digital currency or other digital assets
        (&quot;Digital Assets&quot;) from certain supported blockchain networks
        such as Ethereum (&quot;Supported Networks&quot;), which are then
        represented on Ink (&quot;Bridge Smart Contracts&quot;). The Bridge
        Smart Contract can also be used to withdraw your Digital Assets from Ink
        back to Supported Networks. We do not take possession, custody, or
        control of any Digital Assets on Ink or sent to its Bridge Smart
        Contracts. There is a risk that the open source software, including any
        upgrades, that Ink is built on may introduce bugs, viruses, Trojan
        horses, or other vulnerabilities or changes to Ink that could result in
        a partial or complete disruption of Ink or loss, damage, or destruction
        of your Digital Assets. The Supported Networks, and the types of Digital
        Assets, that are capable of functioning with Ink and the Bridge Smart
        Contracts may also be subject to change at any time. We do not control
        third party applications, including their development or deployment, on
        Ink, or any activity or transactions occurring on Ink.{" "}
        <b>
          Therefore, you acknowledge and agree that Ink, including its Bridge
          Smart Contracts, are not part of our Services, and we have no
          obligations or liability to you in relation to your use of Ink or its
          Bridge Smart Contracts, and you use Ink and its Bridge Smart Contracts
          at your own risk.

      </div>
      <b>3. Our Services</b>
      <div>
        <span className="underline">Interface</span>
      </div>
      <div>
        Our Website includes a user interface (the &quot;Interface&quot;) that
        is intended to allow you to more easily interact with certain
        functionalities of Ink, such as the Bridge Smart Contracts. Other third
        parties may deploy their own applications or interfaces to interface
        with Bridge Smart Contracts, and those other applications or interfaces
        are not part of our Services.
      </div>
      <div>
        <span className="underline">Testnet</span>
      </div>
      <div>
        We operate the Ink testnet (the &quot;Testnet&quot;) as a testing
        environment that is intended to reproduce the functionality and
        experience of Ink. The Testnet is intended to allow you to develop
        applications for Ink and otherwise improve the stability, security, and
        design of Ink and applications built for Ink. Any Testnet tokens are for
        testing purposes on the Testnet, have no value, and are not redeemable
        or convertible for any other token or item of value. We may change,
        upgrade, discontinue, suspend, or terminate the Testnet at any time and
        without notice.
      </div>
      <div>
        <span className="underline">Kraken Sequencer</span>
      </div>
      <div>
        Kraken operates a node that receives, records, and combines multiple
        transaction records from Ink into batches, which are then settled to the
        Ethereum blockchain in a specified format (the &quot;Kraken
        Sequencer&quot;). You are not required to use the Kraken Sequencer. If
        you use the Kraken Sequencer, you agree to pay any applicable gas fees,
        which may be modified at any time. Kraken will attempt to provide
        accurate gas fee information in connection with your use of the Kraken
        Sequencer, but such information reflects its estimate of gas fees, which
        may vary from the fees you actually pay to use the Kraken Sequencer and
        interact with Ink. The Kraken Sequencer does not store, take possession,
        custody, or control of your Digital Assets at any time, except for
        receiving applicable gas fees. It also does not have the ability to
        modify, reverse, or otherwise modify any transactions submitted to the
        Ethereum blockchain. Applicable gas fees received in connection with
        your use of the Kraken Sequencer may be modified at any time.
      </div>
      <b>4. Third Party Services</b>
      <div>
        When using our Services, Ink or the Bridge Smart Contracts you may have
        the opportunity to use or interact with third party services. We do not
        verify, approve, monitor, control or endorse any third-party services
        and are not liable to you for third-party services or third-party
        content displayed or otherwise made available on the Services. We are
        not responsible for, and make no representation as to, any third-party
        content or services. Your use of third-party content or services may be
        subject to additional terms and conditions with third-parties, and we
        are not part of those terms or conditions. You may also incur
        third-party fees, such as fees associated with third-party services, or
        other fees, such as gas fees. You&apos;re solely responsible for paying
        all such fees. If any third-party terms and conditions conflict with
        these Terms, you agree that these Terms control. Under no circumstances
        shall we incur any liability, of any kind, to you arising from or
        relating to fees charged to you by third-party content or services
        linked to or accessed through our Services, Ink or the Bridge Smart
        Contracts. Your interactions with third-party services, including Bridge
        Smart Contracts and digital wallets, are governed by their respective
        privacy policies. We are not responsible for their data practices.
      </div>
      <div>
        To use certain of the Services, you may need to connect a compatible
        third-party digital wallet (&quot;Wallet&quot;) with the Services. By
        using a Wallet in connection with the Services, you agree that you are
        using the Wallet under the terms and conditions of the applicable
        third-party provider of such Wallet. Wallets are not associated with,
        maintained by, or affiliated with us. We accept no responsibility or
        liability to you in connection with your use of a Wallet, and we make no
        representations or warranties regarding how the Services or Ink will
        operate or be compatible with any specific Wallet. The private keys
        necessary to access the assets held in a Wallet are not held by us. You
        are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
        private keys and you are responsible for any transactions signed with
        your private keys. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to
        prohibit certain Wallet addresses from being able to use or engage in
        transactions using the Services.

          IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF.
        </b>
      </div>
      <span className="underline">Informal Process First</span>
      <div>
        We are always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently,
        and most concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by
        emailing user support at legal@inkonchain.com. However, if such efforts
        prove unsuccessful, you may send to us, by email, a written Notice of
        Dispute (&quot;Notice&quot;). The Notice should be sent to
        legal@inkonchain.com and must (a) describe the nature and basis of the
        claim or dispute and (b) set forth the specific relief sought. If we and
        you do not resolve the claim or dispute set out in the Notice within
        sixty (60) calendar days from the date of receipt, we or you may
        commence an arbitration proceeding. It is agreed that this dispute
        resolution procedure is a condition precedent which must be satisfied
        before initiating arbitration.
      </div>
      <span className="underline">Arbitration and its Terms</span>
      <div>
        Subject to the informal process outlined in the preceding paragraph, you
        and us agree to arbitrate any dispute arising in connection with these
        Terms (including questions related to their validity, existence, or
        termination) or your use of the Services, except for disputes in which
        either party seeks equitable and other relief for the alleged unlawful
        use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or
        patents.{" "}
      </div>
      <div>
        The arbitration will be administered in accordance with the Rules of the
        London Court of International Arbitration then in effect (the &quot;LCIA
        Rules&quot;). It will be conducted in English and the parties will keep
        the arbitration proceedings confidential and not disclose any
        information regarding the arbitration (or any underlying claim or
        dispute) to any third party except as required by law.
      </div>
      <div>
        Other than class procedures and remedies expressly prohibited by this
        Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator(s) will have the authority to
        provide any remedy or relief that a court of competent jurisdiction
        could award, including injunctive relief. Any decision or award rendered
        by the arbitrator will be final and binding, and may be overturned by a
        court only for very limited reasons. Any judgment may be entered in any
        court of competent jurisdiction.{" "}
      </div>
      <div>
        If there is any inconsistency between any term of the LCIA Rules and any
        term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this
        Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that
        the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would
        not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also
        follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would.
      </div>
      <div>
        <b>
          It is expressly agreed that any arbitration under these Terms will
          take place on an individual basis – class arbitrations and class
          action are not permitted. You understand that by agreeing to these
          Terms, you and us are each waiving the right to trial by jury or to
          participate in a class action or class arbitration.
        </b>
      </div>
      <span className="underline">Costs of Arbitration</span>
      <div>
        Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator costs and expenses
        will be governed by the LCIA Rules then in effect, except that if you
        demonstrate that any such costs and expenses owed by you under those
        rules would be prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding,
        then we will pay the amount of any such costs and expenses that the
        arbitrator determines are necessary to prevent the arbitration from
        being prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding.
      </div>
      <div>
        Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law.
        The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment
        and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding
        and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the
        arbitrator&apos;s ruling on the merits.
      </div>
      <span className="underline">Batch Arbitration</span>
      <div>
        To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of
        arbitrations, you and us agree that in the event that there are
        one-hundred (100) or more individual claims of a substantially similar
        nature filed against us by or with the assistance of the same law firm,
        group of law firms, or organizations, then within a thirty (30) day
        period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the LCIA shall (a)
        administer the arbitration demands in batches of one-hundred (100)
        claims per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than one-hundred
        (100) claims left over after the batching described above, a final batch
        consisting of the remaining claims); (b) appoint one arbitrator for each
        batch; and (c) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single
        consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees
        due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in
        a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award
        (&quot;Batch Arbitration&quot;). All parties agree that claims are of a
        &quot;substantially similar nature&quot; if they arise out of or relate
        to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar
        legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the
        parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process,
        the disagreeing party shall advise the LCIA, and the LCIA shall appoint
        a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch
        Arbitration process (&quot;Administrative Arbitrator&quot;). In an
        effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative
        Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set
        forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly.
        The Administrative Arbitrator&apos;s fees shall be paid by us. You and
        us agree to cooperate in good faith with the LCIA to implement the Batch
        Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and
        administrative fees for batches of claims, as well as any steps to
        minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (i) the
        appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in
        the resolution of discovery disputes; and (ii) the adoption of an
        expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings. This Batch
        Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a
        class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or
        arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any
        circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.

        AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SHALL BE NULL AND VOID WITH RESPECT TO SUCH

        general, or consolidated or representative action must be brought in a
